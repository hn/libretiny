                        "This is a board definition for the EMW3080-E with 8 MiB of flash found in the Solis S3 WiFi stick. The MCU there is originally equipped with a bootloader that has a 980 KiB application partition size, which is small in relation to the total memory. However, the original application is only a second stage loader, which in turn loads the AliOS 3.0.0 operating system and thus uses the entire flash memory."
